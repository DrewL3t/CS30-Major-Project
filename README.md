# CS30-Major-Project
Drew Letwin, P5

## What is it?
For my major project I would like to create a guitar hero style game that can be easily played with just the mouse and keyboard. As such, I've decided to essentially create a "piano-hero" game, as assigning keyboard keys to keys on a piano will be pretty straightforward.
## How will I do this?
Creating the main game will be pretty straightforward. First I will have to create a piano, for which I will simply use a PImage for aesthetic and simplicity. I will then assign each key on the keyboard to a note on the piano and play a sound effect when a note is pressed. Songs will be written by translating textfiles into rectangles that fall in line with the notes which the player will have to hit at the right time for the note to be "hit". Other than that, I may need extra screens such as a title screen and song selection screen that display before the main game.
## Why am I doing this?
I love the guitar hero games and always found them super entertaining. Ever since the first time I played them I figured that the basic game would  actually be pretty simple to code, so this project will be my stab at it. Music is also very important to me so it's natural that my major project would have something to do with it.
