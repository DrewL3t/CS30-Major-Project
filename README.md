## What is it?
For my major project I would like to create a guitar hero style game that can be easily played with just the mouse and keyboard. As such, I've decided to essentially create a "piano-hero" game, as assigning keyboard keys to keys on a piano will be pretty straightforward.
## How will I do this?
